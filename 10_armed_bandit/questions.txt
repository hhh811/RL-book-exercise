# question about gradient bandit algorithm
# When eg. 2 actios' value are initialized to each other,
# first several actions are picked very randomly, if the 2nd-
# big-value action is picked often and the 1st-big-value aciton
# is picked for very few times, the pi(2nd-big-value action)
# will grow fast to close to 1. Then for the rest of the steps,
# most of the actions picked will be the 2nd-big-value action,
# it will be almost impossible for the 1st-big-value action to get
# picked and enhance its preference.
